\section{Automatic Detection in Magnetostatic Surveys using Convolutional Neural Networks}
I started work in the field of automated detection in geophysical surveys in 2017, where I first developped, with the help of my colleague Fabien GOGLIO, a simple \gls{cnn} that could categorise low resolution images of magnetostatic surveys. 

Those surveys were centered mainly on the archaelogical dig of Marsal, France. The project proved to be a success, with high precision being achieved rapidly. However, this was just a proof of concept; showcasing that this kind of techniques could work for this type of data which is very challenging for traditionnal computer vision.
