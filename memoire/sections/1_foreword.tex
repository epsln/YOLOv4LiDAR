This internship was not as traditional as it could have been: both because of the COVID-19 Situation, which profoundly modified the course of my work, but also because it was at its heart a research position, and not a more traditional developper/manager type of work. While this type of work is not typically assumed by engineers in their final year of study, this experience has proven to me to be unvaluable, as it has allowed me to delve deep into research I have been doing in my free time; and gave me the means and the time to create what was only a dream for me a few years ago: a dedicated object detection model optimized for Archaelogical Geophysical Surveys. 

As such, this document is also not traditional, and will take both the place of an internship report, and a form of thesis, where I will detail the work I have been undertaken during the past two years in the field of automated detection in geophysical surveys.
