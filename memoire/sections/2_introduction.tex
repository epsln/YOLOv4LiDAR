This document is served as the final assignment of my graduate engineering degree which concludes my 5 year as an ESIEA Student.  This document details my work during my 6 month stay as an intern and research student at Leiden University. 

I can only give my deepest and most sincere thanks to the Leiden University and both Professor Lambers and Mr. V. D. Schoof for their help. This institution accepted my offer and gave me an opportunity to push myself, which I will stay forever grateful for.
