	title = "Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Rare Sound Event Detection",
	abstract = "Sound events possess certain temporal and spectral structure in their time-frequency representations. The spectral content for the samples of the same sound event class may exhibit small shifts due to intra-class acoustic variability. Convolutional layers can be used to learn high-level, shift invariant features from time-frequency representations of acoustic samples, while recurrent layers can be used to learn the longer term temporal context from the extracted high-level features. In this paper, we propose combining these two in a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for rare sound event detection. The proposed method is evaluated over DCASE 2017 challenge dataset of individual sound event samples mixed with everyday acoustic scene samples. CRNN provides significant performance improvement over two other deep learning based methods mainly due to its capability of longer term temporal modeling.",

	abstract = "Rare sound event detection is a newly proposed task in IEEE DCASE 2017 to identify the presence of monophonic sound event that is classified as an emergency and to detect the onset time of the event. In this paper, we introduce a rare sound event detection system using combination of 1D convolutional neural network (1D ConvNet) and recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory units (LSTM). A log-amplitude mel-spectrogram is used as an input acoustic feature and the 1D ConvNet is applied in each time domain segment to convert the spectral feature. Then the RNN-LSTM is utilized to incorporate the temporal dependency of the extracted features. The system is evaluated using DCASE 2017 Challenge Task 2 Dataset. Our best result on the test set of the development dataset shows 0.07 and 96.26 of error rate and F-Score on event-based metric, respectively.",

  abstract = {This paper proposes a Fast Region-based Convolutional Network method (Fast R-CNN) for object detection. Fast R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals using deep convolutional networks. Compared
to previous work, Fast R-CNN employs several innovations to improve training and testing speed while also increasing detection accuracy. Fast R-CNN trains the very
deep VGG16 network 9× faster than R-CNN, is 213× faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3× faster, tests 10× faster, and is more accurate. Fast R-CNN
is implemented in Python and C++ (using Caffe) and is available under the open-source MIT License at https: //github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn.},

When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recoginition benchmarks can be obtained by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.}

while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each
instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a
branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for
bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small
overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to
generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the
same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of
challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and
person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms
all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016
challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a
solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class. },
